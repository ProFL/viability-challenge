# viability-challenge

Implementation of a little job interview challenge I once proposed (for a Node.js backend programmer job)
in Golang, used for study and exploration purposes.

The scenario is as follows:

```
  You work for an ISP and you need to build an endpoint to check whether you have
  the viability to provide internet to a given client. Given a database with your
  cable splitters positions, and given a maximum distance from the client and the
  splitter of 150m, develop a system that can check such viability.
```

The original challenge, as proposed in Portuguese is available in [this gist](https://gist.github.com/ProFL/dccace0908c0866d16607c2ea86112ab).
